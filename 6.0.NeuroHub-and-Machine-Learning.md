Within NeuroHub it is possible for researchers and their teams to access a variety of datasets for the purposes of applying machine learning techniques.

An example of such an interface made available is that of the [Neurodataloader](https://github.com/neurodatascience/neurodataloader) created as part of NeuroHub that enables access to BIDS-like datasets into [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
