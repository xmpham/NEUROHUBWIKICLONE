NeuroHub grants access to its UK Biobank project through the application process outlined in [Section 1.1](1.1.Get-a-NeuroHub-account) and [Section 1.2](1.2.UKBiobank-Access-Request). Researchers who have been approved are invited to join the project on NeuroHub, where they can run a number of analysis pipelines. Direct access to the data is also possible, and how to do so is described in this section.  

To access the data, you will need a Compute Canada account and a Compute Canada Role Identifier (CCRI) associated with that account. If you did not submit your CCRI when first creating your account, contact [support@neurohub.ca](mailto:support@neurohub.ca) and send it to us.  
Once we have your CCRI, you will be granted access to the data. You can verify that you have access by checking your groups (log in to Beluga and type `groups`; you will see `cq-ukb-neurohub` when you have been correctly added).
