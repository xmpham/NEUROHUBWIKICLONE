You can store [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) in NeuroHub projects and run them on HPC resources such as the [BÃ©luga JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.beluga.computecanada.ca) (if you have a [Compute Canada account](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/)) or the [McGill Syzygy JupyterHub](https://mcgill.syzygy.ca) (if you have a [McGill username](https://mcgill.service-now.com/itportal?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010641)).

* Using your McGill account, go to [McGill Syzygy JupyterHub](https://mcgill.syzygy.ca)
* click on _Login_ and insert your account information

* you are forwarded to the Jupyter Notebook surface

* here you can _upload_ an existing notebook or create a _new_ notebook using two different kernels: _Phyton 3_ and _R_



Jupyter notebook examples are being developed at
[neurohub/neurohub_examples](https://github.com/neurohub/neurohub_examples). So far there is a basic example of how to access NeuroHub using the [CBRAIN API](https://portal.cbrain.mcgill.ca/swagger#/).  Neuroimaging and ML examples will follow.

**NOTE**: While you can use the JupyterHubs above for any interactive computing, the use of the current notebook examples requires some coding experience.  Furthermore, the process is currently not automated, you will have to move notebooks and data to and from the JupyterHub.
