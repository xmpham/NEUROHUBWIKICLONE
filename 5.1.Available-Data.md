## March 8, 2022 - Compute Canada Narval and Beluga Systems offline affecting UK Biobank Dataset Access
The Narval and Beluga systems of Compute Canada are offline since March 8, 2022 due to a major issue at the Compute Canada data centre. All compute and storage resources access is offline. This includes all access to the UK Biobank datasets through NeuroHub.  Presently we are downloading and reinstalling the UK Biobank tabular, imaging and genetic data onto the Graham system.  All data files are located in the following directory on Graham (graham.computecanada.ca):
> /project/rpp-aevans/neurohub/ukb/

The tabular data has been downloaded and is available on Graham at:
> /project/rpp-aevans/neurohub/ukb/Dataset/

The imaging data is being downloaded and prepared for installation.  Please check back regularly for updates regarding the restoration of access to the UK Biobank data.

***

This section provides a summary of the data available through Compute Canada. All data is stored on the [Beluga](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/B%C3%A9luga/en) cluster. The data is stored under the `rpp-aevans-ab` allocation in the following directory:  
> /project/rpp-aevans-ab/neurohub/ukbb/  

## Tabular
The tabular files contain data that can be summarized by a few entries (e.g. age, blood pressure). The available data fields are summarized in the [Data Dictionary](dict/dataset.html) (right-click -> save -> open .html file in your browser), and the most recent version of the data is stored in `tabular/`. The Unique Data Identifier (UDI) for each piece of data consists of three parts: `[Datafield]-[Instance Index].[Array Index]`:  
* **Datafield** refers to the type of data: `2207` is the datafield for whether the subject wears glasses or contact lenses.  
* **Instance Index** refers to the [instance of data acquisition](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/instance.cgi?id=2). `0-1` are the initial and repeat assessments. `2-3` are the imaging and repeat imaging visits.  
* **Array Index** refers to the index within an array. Some datafields have multiple values (e.g. 3060-0.0, 3060-0.1, 3060-0.2), and these are stored separately.  
  
A number of formats are available: csv, sas, stata, and r.  
* `.csv`:  
	Comma-separated values. General-purpose format. Each row describes a subject; each column describes a datafield.  
* .`sas` / `.sd2`:  
	Format for SAS statistical analysis package.  
* `.stata`:  
	Format for the Stata statistical analysis package.  
* `.r` / `.tab`:  
	Format for use with R.  
* `.txt`:  
	Tab-delimited values. Similar to .csv.
* `.bulk`:  
	List of bulk fields per participant.
* `.html`:  
	Documentation about the field data dictionary and encodings.

### Versions  
The data is periodically updated. Old versions are stored in `tabular/archive/`, with the directories identified by the code for the basket. In the case of subject withdrawals, old versions are also purged and researchers are expected to remove withdrawn subjects from any local subsets.  

### Working with CSV Files

`awk` is a good, general-purpose tool for slicing and dicing csv files.  Simpler and faster, though, is using [XSV](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv). To load XSV on [Alliance](https://alliancecan.ca/en) resources:
```
module load rust
cargo install xsv
export PATH=~/.cargo/bin:$PATH
```
