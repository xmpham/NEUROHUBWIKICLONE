This section provides a summary of the data available through Compute Canada. All data is stored on the [Beluga](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/B%C3%A9luga/en) cluster. The data is stored under the `rpp-aevans-ab` allocation in the following directory:  
> /project/rpp-aevans-ab/neurohub/ukbb/  

## Tabular
The tabular files contain data that can be summarized by a few entries (e.g. age, blood pressure). The available data fields are summarized in the [Data Dictionary](dict/dataset.html) (right-click -> save -> open .html file in your browser), and the most recent version of the data is stored in `tabular/`. The Unique Data Identifier (UDI) for each piece of data consists of three parts: `[Datafield]-[Instance Index].[Array Index]`:  
* **Datafield** refers to the type of data: `2207` is the datafield for whether the subject wears glasses or contact lenses.  
* **Instance Index** refers to the [instance of data acquisition](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/instance.cgi?id=2). `0-1` are the initial and repeat assessments. `2-3` are the imaging and repeat imaging visits.  
* **Array Index** refers to the index within an array. Some datafields have multiple values (e.g. 3060-0.0, 3060-0.1, 3060-0.2), and these are stored separately.  
  
A number of formats are available: csv, sas, stata, and r.  
* .csv:  
	Comma-separated values. General-purpose format. Each row describes a subject; each column describes a datafield.  
* .sas:  
	Format for SAS statistical analysis package.  
* .stata:  
	Format for the Stata statistical analysis package.  
* .r / .tab:  
	Format for use with R.  
  
### Versions  
The data is periodically updated. Old versions are stored in `tabular/archive/`, with the directories identified by the code for the basket. In the case of subject withdrawals, old versions are also purged and researchers are expected to remove withdrawn subjects from any local subsets.

## Requests
Are there new datafields or return datasets that you'd like to be made available? Send us an email at [support@neurohub.ca](mailto:support@neurohub.ca) with a text file with the following information in a single column:  
* Datafields, prepended with 'F' (e.g.: "F20252")  
* Return datasets, prepended with 'R' (e.g.: "R123")  
* SNP IDs prepended with 'S' (e.g. "S456").  
  
Is there bulk data that is already authorized but unavailable? Let us know at [support@neurohub.ca](mailto:support@neurohub.ca); we prioritize data with community interest.
