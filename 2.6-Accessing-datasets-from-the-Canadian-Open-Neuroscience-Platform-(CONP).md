## Short description of the available datasets

### [CONP Visual Working Memory](https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/visual-working-memory) 
Nineteen right-handed healthy adults (aged from 18-28 years old) participated in this study on the same 3 T MRI scanner. Axial 3D T1-weighted images were acquired as well as three runs of bold task MRI with the recording of their related behavioural data.

### [CONP Open Pain](http://openpain.org/)

### [CONP SIMON](https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/SIMON-dataset)
The Single Individual volunteer for Multiple Observations across Networks (SIMON) MRI dataset is a sample of convenience of one ambidextrous healthy male aged between 29 and 46 years old, scanned in 73 sessions at multiple sites and with various scanner models.

### [CONP BigBrain](https://bigbrainproject.org)
The BigBrain dataset is a digitized reconstruction of high-resolution histological sections of the brain of a 65 years old man with no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases. This dataset is the result of a collaborative effort between the teams of Dr. Katrin Amunts and Dr. Karl Zilles (Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich) and Dr. Alan Evans (Montreal Neurological Institute). This dataset contains the 3D 40 microns blocks of the BigBrain as well as the 3D histological volumes at different isotropic resolutions (100 to 400 microns) in MNI space and histological space.


### [CONP CFMM-7T](https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/CFMM_7T__MP2RAGE_T1_mapping)
BIDS-formatted 7T MRI MP2RAGE and Sa2RAGE data acquired at the Centre for Functional and Metabolic Mapping in London (Ontario, Canada) + Snakemake workflow for analyses as performed in 'Effects of MP2RAGE B1+ sensitivity on inter-site T1 reproducibility and morphometry at 7T.

### [CONP Murine Neocortical Neurons](https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/Intracellular_Recordings_of_Murine_Neocortical_Neurons) 
This dataset contains intracellular electrophysiological current-clamp recordings from murine neocortical neurons.

### [CONP NIH-NHP Atlas](https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/nhpatlas)
The NIH Blueprint Non-Human Primate (NHP) Atlas consists of a suite of gene expression and neuroanatomical data for exploring the cellular and molecular architecture of the developing rhesus macaque brain.

### [CONP 1000 Genomes](https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/1000GenomesProject)
The 1000 Genomes Project provides a comprehensive description of common human variation by applying a combination of whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing and dense microarray genotyping to a diverse set of 2504 individuals from 26 populations. Over 88 million variants are characterized, including >99% of SNP variants with a frequency of >1% for a variety of ancestries.
