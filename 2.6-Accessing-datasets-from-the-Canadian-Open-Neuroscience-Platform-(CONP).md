### CONP Visual Working Memory 
Nineteen right-handed healthy adults (aged from 18-28 years old) participated in this study on the same 3 T MRI scanner. Axial 3D T1-weighted images were acquired as well as three runs of bold task MRI with the recording of their related behavioural data.

### CONP BigBrain
The BigBrain dataset is a digitized reconstruction of high-resolution histological sections of the brain of a 65 years old man with no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases. This dataset is the result of a collaborative effort between the teams of Dr. Katrin Amunts and Dr. Karl Zilles (Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich) and Dr. Alan Evans (Montreal Neurological Institute). This dataset contains the 3D 40 microns blocks of the BigBrain as well as the 3D histological volumes at different isotropic resolutions (100 to 400 microns) in MNI space and histological space.

### CONP 1000 Genomes
The 1000 Genomes Project provides a comprehensive description of common human variation by applying a combination of whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing and dense microarray genotyping to a diverse set of 2504 individuals from 26 populations. Over 88 million variants are characterised, including >99% of SNP variants with a frequency of >1% for a variety of ancestries.
